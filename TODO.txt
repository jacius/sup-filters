I am not working on this software anymore, but here are some ideas for
how it could be improved in the future. Some of them may require
extending Sup itstelf.

- Ability to easily apply filters to messages at any time, from within
  Sup. Ideally, apply filters to all tagged messages.

- Easier syntax for multiple conditions. Maybe space-separated string.

- A way to edit and add filters from within Sup.

- Add "body:regexp" condition (matches message body). I couldn't
  figure out how to do it. See BodyCondition in lib/filter.rb.

- Automatically reload cached filters if the file has changed.
